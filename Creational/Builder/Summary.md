# Abstract Factory

This example was made on the idea of ordering types of computers (Laptop and Desktop Computer) from different providers (Apple and Dell).  
The required parts of these computers are:

- Case
- Motherboard
- Power Source
- Processor
- RAM
- VideoCard

This Builder uses an Abstract Factory to create the specific parts of the computer and then returns either a Laptop or a Desktop Computer from a specific provider.
