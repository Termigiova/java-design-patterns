# Prototype

It's a creational design pattern which lets you make faithful copies of objects without depending on their classes.

## Problem

You might encounter a case where you want to make a new PC, you have a desktop computer which you are going to use as a base but the only thing you can see is the exterior, you have no idea how it works on the inside. So you hit a brick wall trying to find out how to build your new PC without knowing those specifics details.

## Solution

Delegate the process of cloning to the actual object, no one knows them better than themselves.
